  - **Network**: Start only if a network connection is available.
  - **Wake to Run**: enhance reliability by waking the computer to execute the task.

### 🎨 Customization

- **Mica Effect**: Enable or disable the Mica effect for a more premium look.
- **Animated Icons**: UI elements that come to life, like the Settings icon that reacts to your touch.

- **Tray Badge**: See the number of currently running tasks at a glance directly on the tray icon.
- **Multi-Window Tray Management**: Open multiple windows and manage them independently from the tray right-click menu — restore or close individual windows, or open a new one, all from a single tray icon.
- **Tray Notification**: A toast notification appears the first time the app is minimized to tray, with a click action to restore the window instantly.
- **Single Instance**: Launching the app a second time brings the existing window to the front instead of opening a duplicate.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Crash Logs**: If the application encounters a critical error, a `Crash_Log.txt` file is generated in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FluentTaskScheduler\`.
- **Admin Rights**: Some features (like "Run as SYSTEM") require the application to be run as Administrator.
- **Preferences storage**: The application stores its preferences as well as the log and custom script files in a JSON file in "%localappdata%\FluentTaskScheduler".
- **Portable distribution**: The portable release is a **ZIP archive** (folder), not a single `.exe`. WinUI 3 requires its native runtime DLLs to be present alongside the executable; single-file bundling is not supported and will crash on startup.
