# To Do:

1. ***More TBD***
2. ~~Translate the v1.9.0 additions (Snooze, Pipelines, Dashboard analytics, Library/Templates, onboarding slides) into `de-DE`, `ja-JP`, `zh-CN`.~~ (Done: all 217 v1.9.0 keys translated into all three locales; every `.resw` now has identical key counts.)
3. Submit the updated Scoop / Chocolatey / WinGet manifests once the v1.9.0 GitHub Release is published.
4. ~~**Fix the in-app auto-updater's arch collision before ever uploading `releases.win.json`/`.nupkg` to a GitHub Release.**~~ (Done: Fixed in V1.9.0. Added -c win-x64/win-arm64 at pack time, and pass ExplicitChannel to UpdateOptions).

# Changelog:

## [Unreleased]

## [V1.9.0] - 2026-07-25

### Task Chaining & Execution Pipelines
- New "Completion Actions" section in the task editor: chain downstream tasks to run when a task
  succeeds (exit code 0) or fails (any other code), configured through a dedicated Fluent-styled
  dialog (`TaskPipelineDialog`).
- An event-driven `TaskPipelineService` watches the Task Scheduler operational log (no polling) and
  starts the configured downstream tasks, with cycle detection and a rate limit to prevent runaway
  chains.
- Tasks with a configured pipeline now show a "Chained" badge in the task list.

### Global Snooze / Pause
- "Snooze All Tasks" pauses task execution app-wide for 30m / 1h / 3h / until next reboot / a custom
  time, with an optional "suspend scheduled triggers" mode that disables tasks at the OS level and
  restores them automatically when the snooze ends.
- Snooze status is surfaced via a banner on the task list, a toolbar button next to Sort, and the
  system tray icon/tooltip.

### Dashboard Analytics
- Added a 24-hour execution heatmap, a health-score ring, average/longest run duration, 24h/7d
  throughput, and a filterable live execution log (Success / Failed / Snoozed).
- Replaced the old per-task history polling with a single bulk read of the Task Scheduler event log,
  which is both faster and the basis for the new analytics.
- The Dashboard now fills the full available width instead of being centred inside a fixed 1400px
  column, which left large empty gutters on either side with the sidebar open (#20).
- All figures stay hidden until a load finishes, so partially-populated or zeroed statistics no
  longer flash on screen while the Dashboard is refreshing.

### Library: Task Templates + Scripts, merged
- Merged the separate Script Library and a new Task Template Library into one "Library" page with a
  segmented switcher and a shared search box.
- 17 built-in templates across System Maintenance, Developer Tools, and Power & Utility (temp
  cleanup, restore points, DISM/SFC scan, Git fetch, Docker prune, project backup, idle shutdown,
  and more). Deploying one opens the task editor pre-filled — nothing is registered until you save.

### Localization fixes
- Found and fixed the root cause of the app showing OS-language text regardless of the in-app
  language picker: many dialogs used `x:Uid`, which resolves against the *Windows display language*
  instead of the selected app language. Removed all remaining `x:Uid` usages and routed everything
  through `LocalizationService`.
- `.NET` culture (`CultureInfo`) is now synced to the language picker, so dates, numbers, and
  framework-generated text follow the app language too, not just `.resw` lookups.
- Task History entries are now built from the event's own data fields instead of Windows'
  pre-rendered (OS-language) description, for every event type the app understands.
- The About page version number is read from the assembly at runtime — it can no longer drift out of
  sync with the actual build, and all four locales now carry a translated version format string.

### Settings & UI polish
- Moved Export/Import Settings ("Data") into the Advanced panel.
- Categories & Tags now list vertically at full width instead of a cramped horizontal wrap.
- OLED Mode now follows the *effective* theme (including "System Default" resolving to a dark OS)
  instead of only the stored theme preference, which previously left it greyed out incorrectly.
- Replaced the sidebar's Running/Enabled/Disabled entries with a single status dropdown (now
  including "Snoozed") next to the search box in the task list toolbar.
- CSV history exports now write a UTF-8 BOM so non-ASCII task/user names survive the round trip.

### Onboarding
- Added two new walkthrough slides covering task chaining/snooze and the dashboard/library, and
  refreshed several step icons.

## [Full-app correctness audit]
Ran a systematic audit of every feature in the app after finding the trigger start-time/recurrence
bugs. Found and fixed 26 issues, from silent data loss to dead code:

**Data-loss / silently corrupted existing data:**
1. Script Editor "Save" wiped all saved script templates on every save.
2. Editing an existing task silently cleared `OnlyIfAC` / `OnlyIfNetwork` / `WakeToRun`.
3. Folder rename/move could silently drop a task if copying it failed.
4. "Restart on failure" could be silently dropped on save if the interval failed to parse.

**Features that didn't do what they claimed:**
5. Task expiration date/time was completely unwired.
6. "Stop task if runs longer than" was completely unwired.
7. Idle-trigger duration, Event-trigger fields, and idle Conditions settings were completely unwired.
8. History date filter (Today/Yesterday/This Week/All Time) was a no-op.
9. Dashboard "Run History" chart over-counted failures.
10. Dashboard chart/recent-activity/failed-list silently capped at the 20 most-recently-run tasks.
11. Import Settings didn't actually re-localize the running app.
12. Tray icon was never removed on Exit, leaving a ghost icon.
13. "Task Started"/"Task Failed" toast notifications didn't route back into the app on click.
14. Quick Actions status could be clobbered mid-run by a stale reset timer from a previous run.
15. `sfc`/`DISM` Quick Actions had a stdout pipe-buffer deadlock risk.
16. Update-apply failures were silently swallowed with zero user-facing feedback.
17. Stats-panel "Failed" count and the "Failed" filter disagreed on what counted as a failure.
18. `WhatsNewDialog` could throw if GitHub returned `null` for a release's fields.

**Lower severity (leaks, dead code, minor UX):**
19. `EventLogReader` was never disposed — native handle leak.
20. `Error_Log.txt`/`Crash_Log.txt` had no size cap.
21. Batch Stop didn't clear the spinning-ring state the way single-task Stop does.
22. History detail dialog omitted `ExitCode`.
23. Ctrl+N could throw if pressed while another dialog was already open.
24. Dashboard language-switch edge case could zero out the dashboard for languages missing from a hardcoded string list (e.g. ja-JP) — replaced with a language-independent flag.
25. Removed ~150 lines of dead COM interop code (`NlmInterop.cs`).
26. `SettingsService` load/save failures are now logged instead of silently swallowed.
